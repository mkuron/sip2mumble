<h1>SIP Test Messages</h1>

<p>The files in here are test messages for SIP servers to exercise
various functions.  Contributed by Neil Deason, Anders Kristensen,
Jonathan Rosenberg, Henning Schulzrinne.

<p>SIP interoperabilty test event entrants are strongly encouraged to
run these tests.  In particular entrants to advanced scenario testing at
these events will be expected to have passed all torture tests.

<h2><a href="test1.txt">test1.txt</a></h2>

This message is a correctly formatting SIP message. It contains:

<ul>
<li>line folding all over
<li>escaped characters within quotes
<li>LWS between colons, semicolons, headers, and other fields
<li>both comma separated and separate listing of headers
<li>mix or short and long form for the same header
<li>unknown header field
<li>unusual header ordering
<li>nested comments
<li>unknown parameters of a known header
</ul>

<h2><a href="test2.txt">test2.txt</a></h2>

This message tests support for Proxy-Require and Require. It is a
request that contains both headers, listing new features. Proxies and
clients should respond with a 420 Bad Extension, and an Unsupported
header listing these features.

<h2><a href="test3.txt">test3.txt</a></h2>

This message contains unknown schemes in the Request URI, To, From and
Contact headers of a request.  A server should probably return a not
found error; but other behaviors are acceptable.

<h2><a href="test4.txt">test4.txt</a></h2>

This message is a registration request with an expiration year of 2040. 
This makes sure that a server doesn't crash on seeing a date past Y2038. 
The correct behavior is probably to limit the lifetime to some
configured maximum.

<h2><a href="test5.txt">test5.txt</a></h2>

This is a UAS test.  It is a request that includes an Accept header
without SDP.  The UAS should respond with an error.

<h2><a href="test6.txt">test6.txt</a></h2>

This is a UAS test.  It is a request that includes a body of a non-SDP
type.  The UAS should respond with an error.

<h2><a href="test7.txt">test7.txt</a></h2>

This request message contains a new method, NEWMETHOD.  A proxy should
forward this using the same retransmission rules as OPTIONS or BYE.  A
UAS should reject it with an error, and list the available methods in
the response.

<h2><a href="test8.txt">test8.txt</a></h2>

This message is nearly identical to test7.  It is a request with a new
method, but with a CSeq method tag which does not match.  A proxy should
either respond with an error, or correct the method tag.

<h2><a href="test9.txt">test9.txt</a></h2>

This message is a REGISTER request with an unknown authorization scheme. 
The server should do something reasonable, such as rejecting the
request.

<h2><a href="test10.txt">test10.txt</a></h2>

This message contains two requests, separated by a bunch of whitespace. 
Since the message exceeds the length indicated in the Content-Length
header, the message should be rejected. (Multiple SIP requests per UDP
packet are no longer allowed.)

<h2><a href="test11.txt">test11.txt</a></h2>

This message contains no Call-ID, From, or To header. The server
should not crash, and ideally should respond with an error.

<h2><a href="test12.txt">test12.txt</a></h2>

The message contains a request with an extra Call-ID and To field. The 
server should not crash, and should ideally respond with an error.

<h2><a href="test13.txt">test13.txt</a></h2>

This message contains an Expires header which has illegal values for a 
number of components, but otherwise is syntactically correct.

<h2><a href="test14.txt">test14.txt</a></h2>

This message is a response with a 2nd Via header of
255.255.255.255. The top Via header will need to be modified to
represent the address of the server. On receiving this response, the
top Via header is stripped and the packet forwarded. Since the next
address is the broadcast address, it causes the packet to be broadcast
onto the network. A smart server should ignore packets with 2nd Via
headers that are 255.255.255.255 or 127.0.0.1. At the very least it
should not crash.

<h2><a href="test15.txt">test15.txt</a></h2>

<p>This is a request with the Via and Contact headers incorrect.  They
contain additional semicolons and commas without parameters or values. 
The server should respond with a Bad Request error.

<h2><a href="test16.txt">test16.txt</a></h2>

<p>This is a request message with a  Content Length that is much larger
than the length of the body. When sent UDP, the server should respond
with an error. With TCP, there's not much you can do but wait...

<h2><a href="test17.txt">test17.txt</a></h2>

<p>This is a request message with a negative value for
Content-Length. The server should respond with an error.

<h2><a href="test18.txt">test18.txt</a></h2>

<p>This is a request message with garbage after the end of the SDP
included in the body.  In fact, the server should treat this garbage as
a second request.  However, it is not even close to a valid message. 
The server should therefore ignore it, and forward the first message
normally.

<h2><a href="test19.txt">test19.txt</a></h2>

<p>This is a request with an unterminated quote in the display name of
the To field.  The server can either return an error, or proxy it if it
is successful parsing without the terminating quote.

<h2><a href="test20.txt">test20.txt</a></h2>

<p>This is an INVITE request with a semicolon-separated parameter in the
"user" part. Outbound proxies should direct it appropriately.

<hr>

<p>The files below are additional test messages for SIP servers to
exercise various functions.  Comments and corrections should be sent to
<a href=mailto:ndeason@ubiquity.net>Neil Deason</a>. 

<h2><a href="test21.txt">test21.txt</a></h2>
<p>This INVITE is illegal because the Request-URI has been enclosed within
in "&lt;>".
<p>An intelligent server may be able to deal with this and fix up the
Request-URI if acting as a Proxy.  If not it should respond 400&nbsp;
with an appropriate reason phrase.

<h2>
<a href="test22.txt">test22.txt</a></h2>
<p>This INVITE has illegal LWS within the SIP URL.
<p>An intelligent server may be able to deal with this and fix up the
Request-URI if acting as a proxy.  If not it should respond 400 with an
appropriate reason phrase.

<h2>
<a href="test23.txt">test23.txt</a></h2>
<p>This INVITE has illegal >1 SP between elements of the Request-URI.

<p>An intelligent server may be able to deal with this and fix up the
Request-URI if acting as a proxy.  If not it should respond 400 with an
appropriate reason phrase.

<h2>
<a href="test24.txt">test24.txt</a></h2>
<p>This INVITE is legal and has a Request-URI with a SIP URL containing
escaped characters.

<h2>
<a href="test25.txt">test25.txt</a></h2>
<p>This INVITE is illegal as it the Request-URI contains a SIP URL
containing escaped headers.

<p>An intelligent server may be liberal enough to accept this. A server
acting as a proxy should remove the escaped header before processing.

<h2>
<a href="test26.txt">test26.txt</a></h2>
<p>This INVITE contains an unknown URI scheme in the Request-URI.

<p>A server should reject this message with a 400 response plus an
appropriate reason phrase despite being able to understand the To header
as a SIP URL.

<h2>
<a href="test27.txt">test27.txt</a></h2>
<p>This OPTIONS request is legal despite there being no LWS between the
display name and &lt; in the From header.

<h2>
<a href="test28.txt">test28.txt</a></h2>
<p>This OPTIONS request is legal despite there being extra LWS between the
display name and &lt; in the From header.

<h2>
<a href="test29.txt">test29.txt</a></h2>
<p>This INVITE is illegal as it contains a non GMT time zone in the SIP Date
of the Expires header.
<p>An intelligent server may be able to fix this up and correct the time
to GMT.  Alternatively this message may illicit a 400 response with an
appropriate reason phrase.

<h2>
<a href="test30.txt">test30.txt</a></h2>
<p>This is a legal INVITE but the message content has long since expired.
<p>A server should respond 408 (Timeout).

<h2>
<a href="test31.txt">test31.txt</a></h2>
<p>This is a legal SIP request with the Max-Forwards header set to zero.
<p>A proxy or gateway should not forward the request and respond 483 (Too
Many Hops).

<h2>
<a href="test32.txt">test32.txt</a></h2>
<p>This is a legal REGISTER message where the Contact header contains a
SIP URL with an escaped header within it.

<h2>
<a href="test33.txt">test33.txt</a></h2>
<p>This is an illegal message as the REGISTER request contains a SIP URL with
an escaped header but it is not enclosed in &lt;>

<p>A server should respond 400 with an appropriate reason phrase.

<h2>
<a href="test34.txt">test34.txt</a></h2>
<p>This is a legal message that contains long values in many headers.

<h2>
<a href="test35.txt">test35.txt</a></h2>
This is an illegal and badly mangled message.
<p>A server should respond 400 with an appropriate reason phrase if it
can. It may just drop this message.

<h2>
<a href="test36.txt">test36.txt</a></h2>
<p>This is a legal message with a large number of SDP attributes and a long
telephone subscriber Request-URI

<h2>
<a href="test37.txt">test37.txt</a></h2>
<p>This REGISTER contains a contact where the 'user' parameter should be
interpreted as being a contact-param and not a url-param.  The register
should succeed but a subsequent retrieval of the registration must not
include "user=phone" as a url-parameter.

<h2>
<a href="test38.txt">test38.txt</a></h2>
<p>This register contains a contact where the 'user' parameter is a
url-param.  The register should succeed and a subsequent retrieval of
the registration must include "user=phone" as a url-parameter.

<h2>
<a href="test39.txt">test39.txt</a></h2>
<p>This is a legal INVITE where the To and From header contain display
names that contain multiple tokens but are unquoted,

<h2>
<a href="test40.txt">test40.txt</a></h2>
<p>This is an illegal invite at the display names in the To and From
headers contain non-token characters but are unquoted.  A server may be
intelligent enough to cope with this but may also return a 400 response
with an appropriate reason phrase.

<h2>
<a href="test41.txt">test41.txt</a></h2>
<p>This should be rejected with 400.  Section 4.1 lists SIP version as a
literal and doesn't say anything about ignoring leading zeros.  As an
example of why rejecting it is a good idea, consider version numbers
like 2.1 and 2.01 - they are unlikely to refer to the same version.

<h2>
<a href="test42.txt">test42.txt</a></h2>
This is an illegal INVITE as the SIP Protocol version is unknown.
<p>The server should respond to the request with a bad version error.
