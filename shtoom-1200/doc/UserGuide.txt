This is a really rough start to using Shtoom.

Registering an account
----------------------

To make it easier for people to reach you, you'll need to get an account on
a SIP service - both FWD and Stanaphone offer free accounts. Once you have 
an account, enter the server name into the register_uri option (make sure you
include the sip: part!), for instance 'sip:sip.stanaphone.com' or 
'sip:fwd.pulver.com'. You'll also need to enter your username into the 
register_user option. Assuming you're using the Gnome or Tk interfaces, you
can ignore the register_authuser and register_authpasswd options. 


Outbound Proxies and NAT
------------------------

If you're behind a Restricted Cone or Port Restricted NAT, you'll need to 
use either UPnP or an outbound proxy. Assuming you have a FWD account, you
can use their proxy - set the option 'outbound proxy url' to::

  sip:fwdnat.pulver.com:5082
